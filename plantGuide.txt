The stems are usually young, soft, and pithy, twigs but the wood is quite hard. The creamy white flowers are in pyramidal heads and followed by round, berry-like fruits called drupes. The fruit normally contains 2-4 seeds and is usually bright red. It propagates by seed following cold stratification.
Seasonal Development
The growing season usually begins in
early June, and flower buds begin to open from mid-June to early July. Fruits and seeds of the Red Elderberry mature between late July and mid-August.

Distribution/Habitat
Sambucus racemosa is found across North America from Newfoundland to Alaska. It is restricted to moist, cool sites in the south, extending into California in the coastal mountains, Arizona and New Mexico in the Rockies, and Georgia and Tennessee in the Appalachian highlands. Red elderberry is not well adapted to warm climates and in the southern part of its range. There it is found in cooler uplands, swamps, and along cool drainages

Interesting Facts
• Red elderberry is moderately fire resistant, re-sprouting from rhizomes or root crowns following fire.
• The hollow stems have been fashioned into flutes and blowguns. References

Sambucus mexicana, Blue Elderberry
General Botanical Characteristics
Blue elderberry is a short-lived, shade intolerant (or slightly tolerant) shrub or small tree, usually between 6.5 feet to 13 feet tall, but sometimes reaching 20 feet. Young twigs are soft and pithy but the wood is quite hard with grayish bark or thin, dark brown, irregularly furrowed and ridged bark. There may be a thick taproot with fibrous, spreading, lateral roots. The leaves are opposite and odd-pinnate with five to nine serrate leaflets. The flowers are white or cream colored. The fruit is edible (caution should be used before eating the fruit because poisonous varieties look similar) and blue-black with a gracious bloom that makes it appear to be powder blue.
Seasonal Development
In California Blue Elderberry blooms from June to September with fruiting in September. In Utah blooms occurs in July and August with fruiting from August to October.
Distribution/Habitat
Blue elderberry's range in western North America is from southern British Columbia and western Alberta to California, Arizona, and New Mexico. It extends east into western Montana, western Colorado, and Trans-Pecos Texas and south into northwest Mexico. Blue elderberry usually occurs in openings in moist forest habitats and in moist areas within drier, more open habitats. It is part of the riparian communities of the Central Valley of California and it is frequently associated with alder and quaking aspen communities.
Interesting Facts
• The fruit of blue elderberry is frequently gathered for wine, jellies, candy, pies, and sauces and it is cultivated commercially in Oregon.
• Native Americans gathered the fruit to cook, dry, or to eat raw. They used a liquid made from the flowers and leaves for medicinal purposes.
• In the spring the young sprouts can be cooked and eaten. Caution should be used in eating elderberries since other species in the genus contain a cyanogenetic glycoside and an alkaloid that can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal pain.

Symphoricarpos albus, Snowberry
General Botanical Characteristics
Symphoricarpos albus, commonly known as Snowberry for its snow-white berries, is a deciduous shrub that is densely branched and varies in height from 3 feet to 4.5 feet. Snowberry can reach heights of 6 feet in riparian areas. They can be identified by their lobed, opposite leaves and clumps of fruit that commonly remain on the plant over winter. It propagates both by seed and rhizomes.
Seasonal Development
Snowberry begins budding in April to May and leaves become full-grown within a month of sprouting. Flowers appear any time from May to August and may be present as late as September. Peak flowering time is June and July. Fruit ripening times are also variable, but typically occur during late August and early September, coinciding closely with leaf fall.
Distribution/Habitat
Snowberry occurs as far north as Alaska, south to California and east to North Carolina. Common snowberry is considered subdominant with Ponderosa Pine in Oregon, and is considered subdominant to Douglas Hawthorn (Crataegus douglasii) and in dense tall shrub communities with Wood's Rose (Rosa woodsii). Some species commonly associated with Snowberry include Ocean spray (Holodiscus discolor) and Bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi).
Interesting Facts
• Snowberry was used on hair as soap, and the fruits and leaves mashed and applied to cuts or skin sores as a poultice and to soothe sore, runny eyes.
• The bark was used for medicinal teas, to treat tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases. A brew made from the entire plant was used as a tonic.
• The straight branches made good arrow shafts and pipe stems. References

Viola glabella, Woods Violet
General Botanical Characteristics
Viola glabella, is commonly known as Stream Violet or Woods Violet. Woods Violet is a low (5cm -300 cm [2''-12"]) colony-forming perennial. Its pencil-thick, knobby green rhizomes can be found on, or just under, the surface of the soil. True roots extend from the lower surface of the rootstock and grip the soil. Its leaves swoop upwards from the end of the rootstock on 5cm-10 cm (2''-4") long petioles. Like those of many other violets, the leaf blades are kidney to heart shaped and toothed.
Seasonal Development
Woods Violet's blossoms open early in the spring before trees leaf out. A brownish capsule packed with seeds develops later. When ripe, the capsule explodes spreading the seeds away from the mother plant.
Distribution/Habitat
It ranges from southern Alaska to California on both sides of the Cascades. Woods violet's natural habitat includes moist woods and especially the edges of streams. It grows abundantly in moist sub alpine environments. At mid to low elevations, the violet is particularly common where deciduous trees form a major part of the forest canopy.
